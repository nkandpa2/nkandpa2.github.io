## About Me <img src="assets/Kody Test.jpg" style="border:5px double #157878; float:right; max-width:20%; margin-left:2%; margin-top:2%">

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina advised by [Dr. Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/).  I am interested in the theory and application of Machine Learning techniques that remain effective in a variety settings, such as limited or unstructured training data and privacy-aware learning.

## Experience

I graduated in 2018 from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Computer Engineering. During my undergrad I did research at the intersection of computer security and deep learning that focused on malware detection.

After graduating I worked for a couple years at a [proprietary trading firm](https://sig.com) as a software engineer. 

During my Ph.D. I spent a summer interning at Adobe Research in their Audio Research Group. There, I worked with [Oriol Nieto](https://www.urinieto.com/about/) and [Zeyu Jin](https://research.adobe.com/person/zeyu-jin/) on [enhancing amateur music recordings](music-enhancement.md) to sound like they had been recorded in a professional environment
