I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina advised by [Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/).  I am interested in the theory and application of Machine Learning techniques that remain effective in a variety settings, such as limited or unstructured training data and privacy-aware learning. Test. Test.
