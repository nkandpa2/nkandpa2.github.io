## About Me <img src="assets/Kody Test.jpg" style="border:5px double #157878; float:right; max-width:20%; margin-left:2%; margin-top:2%">

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina advised by [Dr. Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/).  Most of my research is on understanding the relationship between ML model behavior and the data that it was trained on. I am also interested in privacy and security of ML models, specifically language models.

## Experience

I graduated in 2018 from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Computer Engineering. During my undergrad I did research at the intersection of computer security and deep learning that focused on malware detection.

After graduating I worked for a couple years at a [proprietary trading firm](https://sig.com) as a software engineer. 

During my Ph.D. I've worked at Adobe with [Oriol Nieto](https://www.urinieto.com/about/) and [Zeyu Jin](https://research.adobe.com/person/zeyu-jin/) on [enhancing amateur music recordings](music-enhancement.md). I've also worked at the Google Brain Security and Privacy team with [Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com) on backdoor attacks against language models.
