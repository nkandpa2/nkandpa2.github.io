## About Me <img src="assets/Kody Test.jpg" style="float:right; max-width:20%; padding-left:2%; padding-top:2%">

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina advised by [Dr. Colin Raffel](https://colinraffel.com/).  I am interested in the theory and application of Machine Learning techniques that remain effective in a variety settings, such as limited or unstructured training data and privacy-aware learning.
